# Free data and database setup

ReliefSync is wired to free/public data sources by default. You do not need to request keys for the USGS, GDACS, Open-Meteo, OpenStreetMap Nominatim, or public OSRM integrations. These public services have fair-use or rate limits; do not run bulk jobs against them.

USGS and GDACS provide worldwide coverage directly. NASA FIRMS uses a geographic bounding box in this app, so configure the region you want to query in `FIRMS_AREA`; one huge global request can be slow or exceed provider limits.

NASA EONET v3 is enabled by default and refreshes up to 500 events from the past year without a key. See [Regional data and history](docs/REGIONAL-DATA.md) for ISRO/NRSC and MOSDAC access limits.

## Add your NASA key

1. Request a free MAP_KEY from NASA FIRMS and copy it from the email.
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`.
3. Set `FIRMS_MAP_KEY=your_key` and `FIRMS_AREA=west,south,east,north`, for example `-180,-90,180,90` for a global bounding box. NASA imposes request limits, so a smaller box is more reliable.
4. Set `HTTP_USER_AGENT` to identify your deployment and contact address, as required by the public geocoding service policy.
5. Restart the backend and use **Fetch latest external data** in ReliefSync.

Never put keys in the frontend `.env`, source code, screenshots, or Git. The backend `.env` is ignored by Git.

## Optional MongoDB Atlas

If you want the optional external-observation archive, create a free M0 cluster, add a database user, and allow your development machine's IP in Atlas Network Access. By default the app connects to local MongoDB at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` (no API key). If your local server uses another address, set `MONGODB_URI` in `backend/.env`. For cloud hosting, an Atlas connection string also works. Set `MONGODB_DATABASE=reliefsync`. On the first successful refresh, observations are upserted into the `external_observations` collection with a 2dsphere location index. The API status endpoint checks whether MongoDB is reachable.

At this stage MongoDB stores the fetched external observation archive only. ReliefSync operational records (incidents, volunteers, supplies, shelters, assignments, allocations, and notification campaigns) still use the `DATABASE_URL` SQLAlchemy database (SQLite by default).

## Keep API costs at zero

The app defaults notifications to development mode: in-app notifications are stored locally, and SMS/email delivery is simulated. Do not set `NOTIFICATIONS_MODE=live` or add Twilio/SMTP credentials if you want to avoid paid messaging. Public OSM tiles, Nominatim, and OSRM are light-use community services, not guaranteed production infrastructure.



## MongoDB archive

The app keeps operational state in SQLite and archives source observations separately in MongoDB. With Docker Desktop installed and running, use `docker compose up -d mongodb` in the project root. The included Compose file persists MongoDB data in a named volume and exposes it only on localhost port 27017. The default `MONGODB_URI` in `backend/.env.example` points there. The dashboard shows whether the archive is connected and how many observations it contains.

## Optional Gmail API email sender

Email campaigns can use Gmail API OAuth instead of SMTP. This is a sender integration for the existing preview, explicit approval, recipient-consent, and audit workflow; it does not bypass those controls.

1. In Google Cloud, create/select a project, enable the Gmail API, configure the OAuth consent screen, and create an OAuth client appropriate for your authorized sender.
2. Obtain a refresh token with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` scope for the account that will send campaign mail. Keep client secrets and refresh tokens private.
3. In `backend/.env`, set `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`, `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and `GMAIL_SENDER` to the authorized account address.
4. Keep `NOTIFICATIONS_MODE=development` while checking the app. Only set `NOTIFICATIONS_MODE=live` after verifying consent, target regions and message previews; live SMS separately requires Twilio settings.
5. A Gmail API success is recorded as `accepted_by_provider`, not as delivered. Gmail/inbox delivery may still fail or be delayed.
